<hr style="width: 60%">

















<p>You must understand that Palmer loved his wife as much as ever, or he
  would never have thought of his simple little scheme at all. It was
  entirely for her own good, as he had told himself a dozen times in
  the past day. And with that he stilled whatever qualms of conscience
  he might otherwise have had. He didn't think of himself as being
  something of a murderer.</p>

<p>She was sitting at the artificial fireplace, a cheerful relic of
  ancient days, reading just as peacefully as if she had been back home
  on Mars, instead of on this desolate outpost of space. She had adjusted
  quickly to the loneliness and the strangeness of this life&mdash;to the
  absence of friends, the need for conserving air, the strange feeling of
  an artificial gravity that varied slightly at the whim of impurities in
  the station fuel. To everything, in fact, but her husband.</p>

<p>She seemed to sense his eyes on her, for she looked up and smiled.
  "Feeling all right, dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Naturally. How about you?"</p>

<p>"As well as can be expected."</p>

<p>"Not very good, then."</p>

<p>She didn't reply, and he thought, <i>She hates to admit it, but she
  really envies me. Well, I'll fix it so that she needn't any more.</i> And
  he stared through the thick, transparent metal window at the beauty of
  the stars, their light undimmed by dust or atmosphere.</p>

<p>The stories told about the wretchedness of the lighthouse keepers who
  lived on asteroids didn't apply at all to this particular bit of cosmic
  rock. Life here had been wonderful, incredibly satisfying. At least it
  had been that way for him. And now it would be the same way for his
  wife as well.</p>

<p>He would have denied it hotly if you had accused him of finding
  her repulsive. But to certain drunks, the sober man or woman is an
  offense, and Palmer was much more than a drunk. He was a marak addict,
  and in the eyes of the marak fiends, all things and all people were
  wonderful, except those who did not share their taste for the drug. The
  latter were miserable, depraved creatures, practically subhuman.</p>

<p>Of course that was not the way most of them put it. Certainly it was
  not the way Palmer did. He regarded his wife, he told himself, as an
  unfortunate individual whom he loved very much, one whom it was his
  duty to make happy. That her new-found happiness would also hasten
  her death was merely an unfortunate coincidence. She was sure to die
  anyway, before long, so why not have her live out her last days in the
  peace and contentment that only marak could bring?</p>

<p>Louise herself would have had an answer to that, if he had ever put the
  question to her. He was careful never to do so.</p>

<p>She laid the book aside and looked up at him again. She said, "Jim,
  darling, do you think you could get the television set working again?"</p>

<p>"Not without a mesotron rectifier."</p>

<p>"Even the radio would be a comfort."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do any good, any way. Too much static from both Mars and
  Earth this time of year."</p>

<p>That was the beauty of the marak, he thought. It changed his mood,
  and left him calm and in full command of his faculties, able to handle
  any problem that came up. He himself, of course, missed neither the
  radio nor the television, and he never touched the fine library of
  micro-books. He didn't need them.</p>

<p>A shadow flitted by outside the thick window, blotting out for a moment
  the blaze of stars. It was the shadow of death, as he knew, and he was
  able to smile even at that. Even death was wonderful. When it finally
  came, it would find him happy. He would not shudder away from it, as he
  saw Louise doing now at the sight of the ominous shadow.</p>

<p>He smiled at his wife again, remembering the six years they had lived
  together. It had been a short married life, but&mdash;again the word
  suggested itself to him&mdash;a wonderful one. There had been only one
  quarrel of importance, in the second year, and after that they had got
  along perfectly. And then, two years ago, he had begun to take marak,
  and after that he couldn't have quarreled with anyone. It was a paragon
  among drugs, and it was one of the mysteries of his existence that
  anybody should object to his using it.</p>

<p>Louise had tried to argue with him after she had found out, but he had
  turned every exchange of views into a peaceful discussion, which from
  his side, at least, was brimming over with good humor. He had even
  been good-humored when she tried to slip the antidote into his food.
  It was this attitude of his that had so often left her baffled and
  enraged, and he had a good chuckle out of that, too. Imagine a wife
  getting angry because her husband was too good-natured.</p>

<p>But she was never going to get angry again. He would see to that. Not
  after tonight. A big change was going to take place in her life.</p>

<p>She had picked up another book, and for the moment he pitied her. He
  knew that she wasn't interested in any books. She was merely restless,
  looking for something to do with herself, seeking some method of
  killing time before the shadows outside killed it for her for good and
  all. She couldn't understand his being so peaceful and contented, doing
  nothing at all.</p>

<p>She threw the second book down and snarled&mdash;yes, that was the word,
  "You're such a fool, Jim! You sit there, smug and sure of yourself,
  your mind blank, just waiting&mdash;waiting for them to kill you and me. And
  you seem actually happy when I mention it."</p>

<p>"I'm happy at anything and everything, dear."</p>

<p>"At the thought of dying too?"</p>

<p>"Living or dying&mdash;it doesn't make any difference. Whatever happens,
  I'm incapable of being unhappy."</p>

<p>"If it weren't for the drug, we'd both live. You'd think of a way to
  kill them before they killed us."</p>

<p>"There is no way."</p>

<p>"There must be. You just can't think of it while the drug has you in
  its grip."</p>

<p>"The drug doesn't have you, dear." He asked without sarcasm, "Why don't
  you think of a way?"</p>

<p>"Because I lack the training you have. Because I don't have the
  scientific knowledge, and all the equipment scattered around means
  nothing to me."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done."</p>

<p>Her fists clenched. "If you weren't under the influence of the drug&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know that it doesn't affect the ability to think. Tests have shown
  that."</p>

<p>"Tests conducted by addicts themselves!"</p>

<p>"The fact that they can conduct the tests should be proof enough that
  there's nothing wrong with their minds."</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i>!" she shouted. "I can see it in you. Oh, I know that
  you can still add and subtract, and you can draw lines under two
  words which mean the same thing, but that isn't really thinking. Real
  thinking means the ability to tackle real problems&mdash;hard problems that
  you can't handle merely with paper and pencil. It means having the
  incentive to use your brain for a long time at a stretch. And that's
  what the drug has ruined. It has taken away all your incentive."</p>

<p>"I still go about my duties."</p>

<p>"Not as well as you used to, and even at that, only because they've
  become a habit. Just as you talk to me, because I've become a habit. If
  you'd let me give you the antidote&mdash;"</p>

<p>He chuckled at the absurdity of her suggestion. Once an addict had
  been cured, he could not become addicted again. The antidote acted
  to produce a permanent immunization against the effects of the drug.
  It was the realization of this fact that made addicts fight so hard
  against any attempt to cure them. And she thought that she could
  convince him by argument!</p>

<p>He said, "<i>You</i> talk of not being able to think!"</p>

<p>"I know," she replied hotly. "<i>I'm</i> the one who blunders. <i>I'm</i> the
  fool, for arguing with you, when I realize that it's impossible to
  convince a marak addict."</p>

<p>"That's it," he nodded, and chuckled again. But that wasn't quite it.
  For he was also chuckling at his plan. She had thought him unable to
  tackle a real problem. Well, he would tackle one tonight. Then she
  would simply adopt his point of view, and she would no longer be
  unhappy. After she had accepted the solution he had provided, she would
  wonder how she could ever have opposed him.</p>

<p>He fell into one of his dozes and hardly noticed her glaring at him.
  When he came out of it at last, it was to hear her say, "We have to
  stay alive as long as possible. For the sake of the lighthouse."</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear. I don't dispute that at all."</p>

<p>"And the longer we stay alive, the more chance there is that some ship
  will pick us up."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, there's no chance at all," he asserted cheerfully. "You know
  that as well as I do. No use deceiving yourself, my love."</p>

<p>That, he observed to himself, was the way of non-addicts. They couldn't
  look facts in the face. They had to cling to a blind and silly optimism
  which no facts justified.</p>

<p><i>He</i> knew that there was no hope. <i>He</i> was able to review the facts
  calmly, judiciously, to see the inevitability of their dying&mdash;and to
  take pleasure even in that.</p>

<p>He reviewed them for her now. "Let us see, sweetheart, whether I've
  lost my ability to analyze a situation. We're here with our pretty
  little lighthouse in the middle of a group of asteroids between Mars
  and Earth. Ships have been wrecked here, and our task is to prevent
  further wrecks. The lighthouse sends out a standard high-frequency
  beam whose intensity and phase permit astrogators to estimate their
  distance and direction from us. Ordinarily, there's nothing for us to
  do. But on the rare occasions when the beam fails&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will be the end."</p>

<p>"On those occasions," he continued, unruffled by her interruption, "I
  am supposed to leave my cosy little shelter, so thoughtfully equipped
  with all the comforts of Earth or Mars, and make repairs as rapidly as
  possible. Under the usual conditions, lighthousekeeping is a boring
  task. In fact, it has been known to drive people insane. That's why
  it's generally assigned to happily married couples like us, who are
  accustomed to living quietly, without excitement."</p>

<p>"And that," she added bitterly, "is why even happily married couples
  are usually relieved after one year."</p>

<p>"But, darling," he said, his tone cheerful, "you mustn't blame anyone.
  Who would have expected that a maverick meteor would come at us and
  displace us from our orbit? And who would have expected that the meteor
  would have collided first with the outer asteroids, and picked up a
  cargo of&mdash;those?"</p>

<p>He gestured toward the window, where a shadow had momentarily paused.
  By the light that shone through, he could see that the creature was
  relatively harmless-looking. It had what appeared to be a round,
  humorous face whose unhumorous intentions would be revealed only at
  the moment of the kill. The seeming face was actually featureless, for
  it was not a face at all. It had neither eyes, nor nose, nor mouth.
  The effect of features was given by the odd blend of colors. Almost
  escaping notice because of their unusual position and their dull brown
  hue were the stomach fangs, in neat rows which could be extended and
  retracted like those of a snake.</p>

<p>An hour later he knew that he had made her happy. She was laughing as
  she hadn't laughed for a long time. She laughed at the humorous things
  he said, at the flattering way he raised his glass to her, even at what
  she saw through the window. Sometimes it seemed to him that she was
  laughing at nothing at all.</p>

<p>He tried to think of how he had reacted the first time he had taken
  the drug. He hadn't been quite so aggressively cheerful, not quite
  so&mdash;hysterical. But then, the drug didn't have exactly the same effect
  on everyone. She wasn't as well balanced as he had been. The important
  thing was that she was happy.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, he himself wasn't happy at all.</p>

<p>It took about five seconds for the thought to become clear to him,
  five seconds in which he passed from dull amazement to an enraged and
  horrified comprehension. He sprang to his feet, overturning the table
  at which they still sat. And he saw that she wasn't surprised at all,
  that she still stared at him with a secret satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You've cured me!" he cried. "You've fed me the antidote!"</p>

<p>And he began to curse. He remembered the other time she had tried it,
  the time when he had been on the alert, and had easily detected the
  strange metallic taste of the stuff. He had spat it out, and under the
  influence of the drug from which she had hoped to save him, he had
  laughed at her.</p>

<p>Now he was unable to laugh. He had been so intent on feeding the tablet
  to her that he had forgotten to guard himself, and he had been caught.
  He was normal now&mdash;her idea of being normal&mdash;and he would never again
  know the wonderful feeling the drug gave. He began to realize his
  situation on this horrible lonely asteroid. He cast a glance at the
  window and at what must be waiting outside, and it was his turn to
  shudder.</p>

<p>He noticed that she was still smiling.</p>

<p>He said bitterly, "You're the addict now and I'm cured."</p>

<p>She stopped smiling and said quietly, "Jim, listen to me. You're wrong,
  completely wrong. I didn't give you the antidote, and you didn't give
  me the drug."</p>

<p>"I put it in your wineglass myself."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "That was a tablet I substituted for yours. It's
  an anti-virus dose from our medicine chest. You took one of the
  same things. That's why you feel so depressed. You're not under the
  influence of the drug any more."</p>

<p>He took a deep breath. "But I'm not cured?"</p>

<p>"No. I knew that I wouldn't be able to slip you the antidote. The taste
  is too strong. Later you'll be able to start taking the drug again.
  That is, if you want to, after experiencing for a time what it is to
  be normal. But not now. You have to keep your head clear. You have to
  think of something to save us."</p>

<p>"But there's nothing to think of!" he shouted angrily. "I told you that
  the drug doesn't affect the intelligence!"</p>

<p>"I still don't believe you. If you'd only exert yourself, use your
  mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said savagely, "I'm not going to bother. Give me those marak
  tablets."</p>

<p>She backed away from him. "I thought you might want them. I took no
  chances. I threw them out."</p>

<p>"Out there?" A horrified and incredulous look was on his face. "You
  mean that I'm stuck here without them? Louise, you fool, there's no
  help for us! The other way, at least, we'd have died happy. But now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stared out the window. The shadows were there in full force. Not
  one now, but two, three&mdash;he counted half a dozen. It was almost as if
  they knew that the end had come.</p>

<p>They had reason to be happy, he thought with despair. And perhaps&mdash;
  he shrank back from the thought, but it forced itself into his
  mind&mdash;perhaps, now that all happiness had gone, and wretchedness had
  taken its place, he might as well end everything. There would be no
  days to spend torturing himself in anticipation of a horrible death.</p>

<p>Louise exclaimed suddenly, "Jim, <i>look</i>! They're <i>frolicking</i>!"</p>

<p>He looked. The beasts certainly were gay. One of them leaped from
  the airless surface of the asteroid and sailed over its fellow. He
  had never seen them do that before. Usually they clung to the rocky
  surface. Another was spinning around oddly, as if it had lost its sense
  of balance.</p>

<p>Louise said, "<i>They've</i> swallowed the tablets! Over a hundred
  doses&mdash;enough to drug every beast on the asteroid!"</p>

<p>For a moment Palmer stared at the gamboling alien drug addicts. Then
  he put on his spacesuit and took his gun, and, without the slightest
  danger to himself, went out and shot them one by one. He noted, with a
  kind of grim envy, that they died happy.</p>
